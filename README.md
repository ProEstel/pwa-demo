# pwa-demo
PWA Demo  

## Introduction
The purpose is to show various new features of Progressive Web Apps, not actually 'progressive', so it does not work on old browsers. **Chrome** and **Firefox** are recommended (use version as new as possible).    

To run the demo, deploy `./pwa-demo` on any web server (HTTPS recommended). To test Push (this demo only supports Firefox) and Sync (the feature only runs on Chrome), run the SpringBoot project in `./web-push-server-demo`.
